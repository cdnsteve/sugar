# Sugar - AGENTS.md

This file provides context and instructions to help AI coding agents work effectively with the Sugar project.

## Dev Environment Tips

### Project Structure Navigation
```bash

docs/                    # Documentation
config/                  # Configuration templates
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install with optional dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,test,github]"

# Verify installation
sugar --help
```

### Python Environment
- **Required Python**: 3.11+ (supports 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- **Dependencies**: See `pyproject.toml` for complete list
- **Key libraries**: Click, PyYAML, SQLAlchemy, aiosqlite

## Testing Instructions

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run full test suite
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=sugar --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
pytest -m slow          # Slow tests only

# Run specific test files
pytest tests/test_cli.py
pytest tests/test_core_loop.py
```

### CI Configuration Location
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Test matrix**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS with Python 3.11-3.13
- **Coverage**: Uploads to Codecov

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Linting
flake8 sugar --max-line-length=88

# Code formatting
black sugar tests

# Type checking (currently relaxed due to extensive work needed)
mypy sugar  # May have many warnings - type annotations in progress

# Security scanning
bandit -r sugar/
safety check
```

### Error Handling During Testing
- Tests use relaxed failure handling in CI to unblock pipeline
- Focus on core functionality tests first
- Integration tests mock Claude CLI with `/tmp/mock-claude/claude`

## PR Instructions

### PR Title Format
Follow conventional commit style:
- `feat: description` - New features
- `fix: description` - Bug fixes  
- `refactor: description` - Code refactoring
- `test: description` - Test additions/modifications
- `docs: description` - Documentation updates
- `ci: description` - CI/CD changes

### Pre-commit Requirements
1. **Code formatting**: `black sugar tests`
2. **Linting**: `flake8 sugar --max-line-length=88`
3. **Basic tests**: `pytest tests/` (relaxed failures acceptable)
4. **Security check**: `bandit -r sugar/` (review results)

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must include basic tests
- Integration tests should mock external dependencies
- Focus on core functionality over edge cases initially
- Coverage reports help identify untested areas

## Key Project Context

### Sugar's Purpose
Sugar is an autonomous development system that integrates with Claude Code CLI to:
- Continuously discover work from GitHub issues, error logs, code analysis
- Execute development tasks using Claude agents
- Learn and adapt from execution results
- Provide 24/7 autonomous development capabilities

### Architecture Patterns
- **Modular design**: Each component in separate modules
- **Async/await**: Heavy use of asyncio for concurrent operations
- **Database-backed**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy for work persistence
- **CLI-first**: Click-based command interface
- **Configuration-driven**: YAML configuration in `.sugar/config.yaml`

### Integration Points
- **Claude Code CLI**: External process execution via subprocess
- **GitHub API**: Optional GitHub integration for issue discovery
- **File system**: Error log monitoring and code analysis
- **Git operations**: Branch creation, commits, PR management

### Common Patterns
- Use `click.echo()` for user output, not `print()`
- Async functions for I/O operations (database, file system)
- Configuration validation with meaningful error messages
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Path operations using `pathlib.Path`

### Testing Conventions
- Test files: `test_*.py` pattern
- Use `pytest` fixtures from `conftest.py`
- Mock external dependencies (Claude CLI, GitHub API)
- Prefer integration tests that test actual workflows
- Use temporary directories for file system tests
