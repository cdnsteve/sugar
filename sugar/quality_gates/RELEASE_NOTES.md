# Quality Gates Release Notes

**Version:** 2.1.0
**Release Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** 7 of 10 features complete (Phase 1, 2, and 3)

---

## Overview

Quality Gates is a comprehensive verification system for Sugar that prevents false positives and ensures all claims of success are backed by evidence. This release addresses a critical incident where Sugar claimed fixes were complete without actually verifying functionality.

**The Problem:** Sugar would claim "all tests pass" or "functionality verified" without actually running tests or verifying that the application works.

**The Solution:** Quality Gates enforce mandatory verification at multiple levels, blocking commits that lack proof.

---

## What's New

### Phase 1: Critical Features ‚úÖ

**Feature 1: Mandatory Test Execution**
- Blocks commits unless tests are run and pass
- Supports pytest, rspec, and jest test frameworks
- Auto-detects which tests to run based on changed files
- Stores test evidence in `.sugar/test_evidence/{task_id}.txt`
- Configurable validation rules (zero failures, zero errors, max warnings)

**Feature 3: Success Criteria Verification**
- Tasks include structured, verifiable success criteria
- Automatic verification of HTTP endpoints, file existence, test suites
- Task cannot complete until all criteria verified
- Evidence collected for each verification

**Feature 8: Truth Enforcement**
- Requires proof for all claims of success
- Matches claims against evidence
- Blocks commits with unproven claims (in strict mode)
- Generates unproven claims reports

### Phase 2: High Priority Features ‚úÖ

**Feature 2: Functional Verification Layer**
- Verifies actual functionality works in running application
- HTTP request verification using curl (no external dependencies)
- Port listening verification
- Auto-detection of verification needs based on changed files
- Browser automation support (placeholder for future MCP integration)
- Database query verification (placeholder for future implementation)

**Feature 6: Task Pre-Flight Checks**
- Validates environment before starting work
- Supports 5 check types: port, command, tool, git status, file existence
- Blocks task execution if critical checks fail
- Prevents wasted work on broken environments

### Phase 3: Enhancement Features ‚úÖ

**Feature 7: Verification Failure Handling**
- Configurable retry logic for transient failures
- Automatic escalation when retries exhausted
- Detailed failure reports in Markdown and JSON
- Enhanced debugging data collection
- Separate handling for test failures, functional verification failures, and criteria failures

**Feature 10: Work Diff Validation**
- Validates git changes before commit
- Ensures only expected files are changed
- Limits change size (configurable max lines)
- Detects disallowed patterns (debugger, console.log, binding.pry, etc.)
- Requires justification for unexpected changes

## Breaking Changes

### Tasks May Now Fail

Quality Gates may cause tasks to **fail** that previously would have been marked "completed".

**This is intentional and expected behavior.**

**Examples:**

1. **Before:** Sugar claims "all tests pass" ‚Üí Task marked complete
   **After:** Sugar must actually run tests ‚Üí If tests fail, task fails

2. **Before:** Sugar claims "functionality verified" ‚Üí Task marked complete
   **After:** Sugar must verify HTTP endpoint works ‚Üí If endpoint returns 404, task fails

3. **Before:** Any files can be changed
   **After:** Only expected files can be changed ‚Üí If unexpected files modified, commit blocked

### Quality > Speed

It's better to:
- ‚úÖ Fail tasks correctly
- ‚úÖ Identify real issues
- ‚úÖ Build trust in the system

Than to:
- ‚ùå Claim false success
- ‚ùå Ship broken code
- ‚ùå Lose trust in automation

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Sugar Users

1. **Quality Gates are disabled by default** - Your existing workflows continue unchanged

2. **Enable gradually:**
   - Start with Phase 1 (mandatory testing, truth enforcement)
   - Add Phase 2 (functional verification, pre-flight checks)
   - Add Phase 3 (failure handling, diff validation)

3. **Expect some tasks to fail** - This is good! It means Quality Gates are catching issues.

4. **Review failure reports** - Located in `.sugar/failures/{task_id}.md`

### For New Sugar Users

1. Enable all quality gates from the start:
   ```yaml
   quality_gates:
     enabled: true
   ```

2. Define success criteria in your tasks:
   ```python
   "success_criteria": [
       {
           "type": "http_status",
           "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/endpoint",
           "expected": 200
       }
   ]
   ```

3. Configure pre-flight checks for your environment:
   ```yaml
   pre_flight_checks:
     checks:
       - name: "server_running"
         type: "port_check"
         port: 8000
   ```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Bug Fix with Full Verification

```python
task = {
    "id": "fix-login-redirect",
    "title": "Fix /login redirect issue",
    "type": "bug_fix",

    "files_to_modify": {
        "expected": [
            "app/controllers/sessions_controller.py",
            "tests/test_sessions.py"
        ]
    },

    "success_criteria": [
        {
            "type": "http_status",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/login",
            "expected": 200
        },
        {
            "type": "http_no_redirect",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/login",
            "disallowed_status": [301, 302]
        },
        {
            "type": "test_suite",
            "command": "pytest tests/test_sessions.py",
            "expected_failures": 0
        }
    ],

    "functional_verifications": [
        {
            "type": "http_request",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/login",
            "expected_status": 200
        }
    ]
}
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Pre-flight checks verify server is running
2. ‚úÖ Sugar makes code changes
3. ‚úÖ Tests run and must pass
4. ‚úÖ HTTP request verifies /login returns 200
5. ‚úÖ Success criteria validated
6. ‚úÖ Diff validated (only expected files changed)
7. ‚úÖ Commit allowed with evidence

### Example 2: Feature Implementation

```python
task = {
    "id": "add-user-profile",
    "title": "Add user profile page",
    "type": "feature",

    "success_criteria": [
        {
            "type": "http_status",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/profile",
            "expected": 200
        },
        {
            "type": "test_suite",
            "command": "pytest tests/test_profile.py",
            "expected_failures": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

- **Contains:** Command, exit code, failures, errors, duration, full output

### Evidence Report
- **Location:** `.sugar/evidence/{task_id}.json`
- **Contains:** All verifications, outcomes, timestamps

### Failure Reports (Phase 3)
- **Location:** `.sugar/failures/{task_id}.md` (Markdown) and `.json` (JSON)
- **Contains:** Failure type, reason, retry attempts, complete evidence

### Commit Messages

Evidence is included in commit messages:

```
Fix /login redirect issue

Quality Gates:
- Tests: ‚úÖ PASSED
- Success Criteria: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (3/3)
- Claims Proven: ‚úÖ YES
- Functional Verification: ‚úÖ PASSED (2/2)

Evidence:
- .sugar/test_evidence/fix-login-redirect.txt
- .sugar/evidence/fix-login-redirect.json
```

## Performance Impact

Quality Gates add validation time but provide significant value:

| Validation | Typical Duration | Impact |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| Pre-flight checks | < 1 second | Minimal |
| Test execution | Varies by test suite | Required anyway |
| HTTP verification | < 1 second per request | Minimal |
| Success criteria | < 5 seconds total | Minimal |
| Diff validation | < 1 second | Minimal |

**Net benefit:** Prevents shipping broken code, which saves far more time than validation costs.

---

## Testing

All features are covered by comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run all quality gates tests
pytest tests/test_quality_gates.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_quality_gates.py --cov=sugar/quality_gates

# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Test Stats:**
- Total tests: 133
- Quality gates tests: 21
- All tests passing: ‚úÖ

- **Workaround:** Use HTTP request verification

### Database Query Verification (Feature 2)
- **Status:** Placeholder implementation
- **Requires:** Database-specific implementation
- **Workaround:** Use test suites that verify database state

### Screenshot Capture (Feature 2)
- **Status:** Placeholder implementation
- **Requires:** MCP Chrome DevTools integration

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Pre-flight check failed: Port 8000 not listening"
**Solution:** Start your development server or disable the check

**Issue:** "Tests failed with 0 failures but commit blocked"
**Solution:** Check for test errors (not failures). Both must be zero.

**Issue:** "Unexpected files changed"
**Solution:** Add files to `task.files_to_modify.expected` or enable `allow_additional_files`

**Issue:** "Debug statement left in code"
**Solution:** Remove debugger/console.log/binding.pry statements

**Issue:** "HTTP request verification failed with 404"
**Solution:** Verify server is running and URL is correct

See [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) for complete troubleshooting guide.
