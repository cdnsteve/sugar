# Quality Gates - Phase 1 Implementation

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete (Critical Features)

Quality Gates enforce mandatory verification before allowing task completion. This prevents Sugar from claiming success without proof.

## Phase 1 Features (CRITICAL)

### Feature 1: Mandatory Test Execution ✅
**Purpose:** Block commits unless tests run and pass

**How it works:**
1. Before allowing `git commit`, Sugar runs configured test commands
2. Test output is captured and parsed for failures/errors
3. Evidence is stored in `.sugar/test_evidence/{task_id}.txt`
4. Commit is blocked if tests fail or weren't run

**Configuration:**
```yaml
quality_gates:
  mandatory_testing:
    enabled: true
    block_commits: true
    test_commands:
      default: "pytest"
    validation:
      require_zero_failures: true
      require_zero_errors: true
    evidence:
      store_test_output: true
      path: ".sugar/test_evidence/{task_id}.txt"
```

### Feature 3: Success Criteria Verification ✅
**Purpose:** Make success criteria testable and verifiable

**How it works:**
1. Tasks include structured `success_criteria` with expected outcomes
2. Each criterion is automatically verified (HTTP status, file exists, tests pass, etc.)
3. Task cannot complete until all criteria are verified
4. Evidence is collected for each verification

**Supported Criterion Types:**
- `http_status`: Verify HTTP status code
- `http_no_redirect`: Verify URL doesn't redirect
- `test_suite`: Verify test suite passes
- `file_exists`: Verify file exists
- `string_in_file`: Verify string in file
- `browser_element_exists`: (Placeholder for MCP integration)

**Example:**
```yaml
task:
  title: "Fix /login redirect"
  success_criteria:
    - type: "http_status"
      url: "http://localhost:3000/login"
      expected: 200

    - type: "test_suite"
      command: "pytest tests/test_login.py"
      expected_failures: 0
```

### Feature 8: Truth Enforcement ✅
**Purpose:** Require proof for all claims of success

**How it works:**
1. Sugar makes claims like "all tests pass" or "functionality verified"
2. Truth Enforcer checks evidence collector for matching proof
3. Claims without proof cause task to fail (in strict mode)
4. Unproven claims report is generated

**Configuration:**
```yaml
quality_gates:
  truth_enforcement:
    enabled: true
    mode: "strict"  # strict | permissive
    block_unproven_success: true

    rules:
      - claim: "all tests pass"
        proof_required: "test_execution_evidence"
        must_show:
          exit_code: 0
          failures: 0
          errors: 0
```

## Usage

### In Executor Integration
```python
from sugar.quality_gates import QualityGatesCoordinator

# Initialize
coordinator = QualityGatesCoordinator(config)

# Before committing
can_commit, result = await coordinator.validate_before_commit(
    task=task,
    changed_files=["app/models/user.py"],
    claims=["all tests pass", "functionality verified"]
)

if not can_commit:
    logger.error(f"Quality gate failed: {result.reason}")
    # Handle failure - don't commit
else:
    # Add evidence to commit message
    commit_footer = coordinator.get_commit_message_footer(result)
    # Proceed with commit
```

### Example Task with All Features
```python
task = {
    "id": "fix-login-123",
    "title": "Fix /login redirect to homepage",
    "type": "bug_fix",
    "priority": 5,

    # Feature 3: Success Criteria
    "success_criteria": [
        {
            "type": "http_status",
            "url": "http://localhost:3000/login",
            "expected": 200
        },
        {
            "type": "test_suite",
            "command": "pytest tests/test_login.py",
            "expected_failures": 0,
            "expected_errors": 0
        }
    ],

    # Feature 8: Claims that need proof
    "claims": [
        "all tests pass",
        "functionality verified"
    ]
}
```

## Evidence Collection

Evidence is automatically collected and stored:

**Test Evidence:**
- `.sugar/test_evidence/{task_id}.txt` - Full test output
- Includes: command, exit code, failures, errors, examples, duration

**Evidence Report:**
- `.sugar/evidence/{task_id}_evidence.json` - Comprehensive evidence
- Includes: all verifications, outcomes, timestamps

**Commit Message:**
```
Fix /login redirect to homepage

Fixed the redirect issue by...

Quality Gates:
- Tests: ✅ PASSED
- Success Criteria: ✅ VERIFIED (2/2)
- Claims Proven: ✅ YES

Evidence:
- .sugar/test_evidence/fix-login-123.txt
- .sugar/evidence/fix-login-123_evidence.json
```

## Testing

Run quality gates tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_quality_gates.py -v
```

Test coverage includes:
- Test execution validation
- Success criteria verification
- Truth enforcement rules
- Evidence collection
- Coordinator integration

## What's Next: Phase 2 & 3

**Phase 2:** (High Priority)
- Feature 2: Functional Verification (HTTP, Browser, DB)
- Feature 4: Evidence-Based Reporting
- Feature 6: Pre-Flight Checks

**Phase 3:** (Enhancement)
- Feature 5: Claude Code Integration (MCP inheritance)
- Feature 7: Verification Failure Handling
- Feature 9: Task Definition Improvements
- Feature 10: Work Diff Validation

## Benefits

✅ **No More False Positives**: Tasks can't claim success without proof
✅ **Verification Required**: Tests must run and pass
✅ **Evidence Trail**: Every claim backed by evidence
✅ **Trust but Verify**: Sugar's reports become trustworthy
✅ **Quality Enforcement**: No bypassing quality requirements

## Breaking Changes

- Tasks may now **fail** that previously would have been marked "completed"
- This is **intentional** - better to fail tasks correctly than claim false success
- Quality > Speed
