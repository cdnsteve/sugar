Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Steve, creator of Sugar. After months of using Claude Code, I was frustrated with constantly hand-holding AI assistants. They're powerful but reactive - always waiting for instructions.

I built Sugar to solve this:

🎯 Rich Task Context - Beyond simple prompts, add business requirements, technical specs, success criteria
🤖 Specialized Agents - Orchestrator, planner, and quality guardian working together
⚡ Autonomous Execution - Safe autonomous development with validation and dry-run modes
🔌 Native Integration - Full Claude Code plugin with commands, agents, and hooks

Sugar is 100% free and open source (MIT). I'd love to hear what you think!

Try it: pip install sugarai

Happy to answer any questions! 🍰
