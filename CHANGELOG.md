- **New CLI Command Group**: Complete `sugar task-type` command suite for task type management:
  - `sugar task-type add` - Create custom task types with configurable properties
  - `sugar task-type edit` - Modify existing task types (name, description, agent, emoji, patterns)
  - `sugar task-type remove` - Remove custom task types (with safety checks for active tasks)
  - `sugar task-type list` - Display all available task types with default indicators
  - `sugar task-type show` - View detailed information about specific task types
  - `sugar task-type export` - Export custom types to JSON for version control
  - `sugar task-type import` - Import task types from JSON files
- **Default Task Types**: Five built-in types installed automatically but fully customizable:
  - `bug_fix` (üêõ) - Bug fixes and error corrections
  - `feature` (‚ú®) - New features and enhancements
  - `test` (üß™) - Testing and test improvements
  - `refactor` (‚ôªÔ∏è) - Code refactoring and optimization

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-22

### Added

#### Comprehensive Timing Tracking System
- **Database Schema**: Added timing columns to work_items table
  - `total_execution_time`: Cumulative Claude processing time across retries
  - `started_at`: Timestamp when work first began
  - `total_elapsed_time`: Wall clock time from start to completion
- **Automatic Migration**: Existing Sugar databases get timing columns automatically
- **CLI Display Enhancements**: 
  - `sugar list`: Shows timing for completed/failed tasks (‚è±Ô∏è 5.2s | üïê 2m 15s)
  - `sugar view`: Detailed timing information with human-readable durations
- **Core Integration**: Timing tracked automatically during work execution
- **Cumulative Tracking**: Execution time accumulates across failed retries

#### Performance Insights
- **Work Complexity Analysis**: See which tasks take longest to complete
- **Retry Impact Tracking**: Understand cumulative cost of failed attempts  
- **Productivity Metrics**: Track actual vs. wall clock time for work items
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Identify slow work types and patterns

### Technical Details
- **Database Migration**: Automatic column addition with backwards compatibility
- **Timing Calculation**: Uses SQLite julianday functions for precise elapsed time
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing timing data

### üöÄ MAJOR RELEASE: Structured Claude Agent Integration

This release introduces comprehensive Claude agent integration capabilities, preparing Sugar for the future of AI-powered development workflows.

### Added

#### Structured Request Foundation (Phase 1)
- **StructuredRequest/StructuredResponse System**: Complete dataclass architecture with JSON serialization
- **RequestBuilder Factory**: Helper methods for creating different request types (basic, agent, continuation)
- **TaskContext System**: Rich context information including work item metadata, file involvement, and session history
- **ExecutionMode/AgentType Enums**: Type-safe agent selection and execution mode management
- **Dual Execution Paths**: Structured and legacy modes for backward compatibility

#### Agent Selection Engine (Phase 2)
- **Intelligent Agent Selection Algorithm**: Analyzes work items (type, title, description, priority) for optimal agent matching
- **5 Supported Agent Types**:
  - `tech-lead`: Strategic analysis, architecture, complex bugs, high-priority work
  - `code-reviewer`: Code quality, refactoring, optimization, best practices
  - `social-media-growth-strategist`: Content strategy, engagement, audience growth
  - `statusline-setup`: Claude Code status line configuration
  - `output-style-setup`: Claude Code output styling and themes
- **Priority-Based Matching**: Specific keywords override general patterns for precise agent selection
- **Configurable Agent Mapping**: Users can customize agent selection rules via config.yaml
- **Triple-Layer Fallback Strategy**: Agent mode ‚Üí Basic Claude ‚Üí Legacy execution with graceful degradation

#### Enhanced Response Processing (Phase 3)
- **Agent-Specific Parsing**: Tailored extraction patterns for each agent type's output characteristics
- **Quality Assessment System**: 0.0-1.0 quality scores with confidence levels (high/medium/low)
- **Advanced File Detection**: Regex-based extraction supporting 15+ file types with intelligent path cleaning
- **Enhanced Action Extraction**: Deduplication and intelligent prioritization of action items
- **Multi-Layered Parsing**: JSON ‚Üí Enhanced ‚Üí Fallback parsing with comprehensive error handling
- **Performance Analysis**: Execution time optimization detection and workflow efficiency metrics

### Configuration

#### New Config.yaml Sections
```yaml
claude:
  # Structured Request System (Phase 1 of Agent Integration)
  use_structured_requests: true  # Enable structured JSON communication
  structured_input_file: ".sugar/claude_input.json"  # Temp file for complex inputs
  
  # Agent Selection System (Phase 2 of Agent Integration)
  enable_agents: true        # Enable Claude agent mode selection
  agent_fallback: true       # Fall back to basic Claude if agent fails
  agent_selection:           # Map work types to specific agents
    bug_fix: "tech-lead"           # Strategic analysis for bug fixes
    feature: "general-purpose"     # General development for features
